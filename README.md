## Getting Started

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To have a local copy of this project up and running on your local machine, you will first need to install the following software / libraries / plug-ins

```
Nothing
```

See the following section for detailed step-by-step instructions on how to install this software / libraries / plug-ins

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, assume the marker just acquired a computer

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo. You may also include a quick example of what the marker should see if the installation of all required software / libraries / plug-ins was successful.


## Running the tests


### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
